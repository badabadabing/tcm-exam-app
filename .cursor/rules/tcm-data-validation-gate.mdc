# Data Validation Gate

- After any data edit, run validation before concluding work.
- Standard command:
  - `node ./scripts/validate-data.mjs --diseases <path> --syndromes <path>`
- Required checks:
  - `is_key` is boolean
  - `symptoms.items` exists and non-empty
  - `prescription.primary` is non-empty
  - disease/syndrome links are bidirectionally consistent
  - related disease references are valid and not self-referential
- If validation fails, fix data first; do not leave partial broken states.
