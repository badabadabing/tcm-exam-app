# Syndrome Sharding Policy

- Preferred editable pattern: one disease per file (e.g. `D001.json` ... `D059.json`).
- Each shard contains only its own `disease_id` records.
- Keep `syndrome_id` deterministic: `Dxxx_Syy`.
- Before adding a syndrome:
  - ensure `disease_id` exists
  - ensure `syndrome_id` is unique globally
  - ensure disease -> syndrome list is synchronized
- If a merged `syndromes.json` exists, treat it as build output, not primary edit target.
